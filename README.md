## Things You Might Like (‚ù§Ô∏è ?)
**FastHugsTokenizer:** A tokenizer wrapper than can be used with fastai-v2‚Äôs tokenizer.

**FastHugsModel:** A model wrapper over the HF models, more or less the same to the wrapper‚Äôs from HF fastai-v1 articles mentioned below

**Vocab:** A function to extract the vocab depending on the pre-trained transformer (HF hasn‚Äôt standardised this processes üò¢).

**Padding:** Padding settings for the padding token index and on whether the transformer prefers left or right padding

**Vocab for Albert-base-v2:** .json for Albert-base-v2‚Äôs vocab, otherwise this has to be extracted from a SentencePiece model file, which isn‚Äôt fun

**Model Splitters**: Functions to split the classification head from the model backbone in line with fastai-v2‚Äôs new definition of Learner
